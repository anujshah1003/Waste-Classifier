# Waste-Classifier
Recently Deep Learning is so so successful in recognizing and undesratnding images. In this Project I will develop a deep learning model that can learn to classify wastes. 
For the first prototype , I am going to use an existing daatset by stanford called Trashnet - https://github.com/garythung/trashnet
